# ICS.php

ICS.php is a convenient script which generates iCalendar (.ics) files on the fly in PHP.

## Basic usage

Open 'create-ics.php' change the default password from "TestTestTest" to something else, create a folder on your webserver, and then place the files from this repo in that folder. 

When you visit the folder from your browser, fill the form out to create a link to an ICS file for adding to an email or whatever.
